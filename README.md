# GPAcalculator
A chrome extension to automatically calculate overall GPA for all __selected__ classes appeared on UCSD Academic History page.

(I coded this mainly for calculating major GPA, which is not calculated by the school system.)

##Usage
After loading the extension, go to UCSD Academic History page and simply select all classes to be counted for overall GPA (by simply clicking on them).

The calculated GPA will show up on the left side of the screen.
